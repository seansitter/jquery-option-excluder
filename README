jQuery Option Excluder

Given a set of html selects with common options, this jQuery plugin will ensure that the selected 
options are mutually exclusive among the selects (no two selects can have the same selected option). 
When the plugin is initialized, the selected option of each select is removed from all other selects. 
When the option is changed, the newly selected option is removed from the other selects, and the 
previous option is re-added in the place where it originally appeared.

Usage:
$(document).ready(function(){
	$("select.someClass").optionExclude();
});
